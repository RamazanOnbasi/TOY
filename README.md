This grammar is for an imaginary programming language called “TOY” that only allows arithmetic operations and print statements. Figure 1 shows a complete program written in this language.

Important properties of the TOY language are:

•	A program starts with a “BEGIN” word and ends with an “END” word.  
•	Between BEGIN and END words, zero or more statements can be written.  
•	Each statement in this language ends with a semicolon.  
•	Identifiers must start with a letter and can contain any number of letters and digits.  
•	There are two kinds of statements: Print statements and assignment statements.  
•	The syntax for print statements is as in the sample code in Figure 1. (“PRINT” word followed by an identifier, integer literal, or an expression.)  
•	Assignment statements are in the form of (identifier := expression). “:=” symbol is used as the assignment operator.  
•	Expressions  can  contain  parentheses,  arithmetic,  logic,  and  relational  operators.  The operators in this language are given in Table 1 and their precedence order is given in Table 2.  
•	Expressions in parentheses have the highest precedence.  
•	All the operators have left-associativity, except the exponentiation operator which has right- associativity.
